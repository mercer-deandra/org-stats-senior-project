# org-stats-senior-project
Senior Project for project OrgStats

This is the Jupyter Notebook with the code for the OrgStats project.
This is a self-created project for my senior project.

The purpose of this program is to webscrape organization names and the number of members in each organization, 
save this information to a database, and generate 2 tables (using plotly)  and 1 graph (using Matplotlib) on the data retrieved 
from the database.
